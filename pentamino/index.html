		<h1>Pentamino solver</h1>
		<p>This Christmas, we got a really addictive game called <a href="http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/katamino-deluxe.htm">Katamino</a> from our favorite toy store called <a href="http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com">Marbles</a>. The game is really addictive, and caused hours of head-scratching for the entire family - I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. 
		
		<p>The objective of the game is to completely fill a grid with a pre-specified list of pentaminoes, ie., Tetris-like blocks, each occupying 5 squares on the grid. The game is complicated by the fact that each block can be in up to 8 configurations obtained by 4 rotations and a flip. The list of all 8 configurations for one of the pieces are shown below.

		<p>I was stuck on one of the problems (problem 9-A) for a whole day, when I realized that a large part of my approach was primarily trial-and-error. Instead, I decided to code a solver (yes - I cheated :) ). The algorithm is a simple backtracking approach, similar to the ones used for solving Sudoku puzzles. 
		
		<h2>Piece configurations - Piece.py</h2>
		<p>Although it is possible to automatically generate all the configurations of a piece, I decided to hard-code it for simplicity. Since each piece can fit in a 5x5 grid, the representation is based on the indices which are occupied by the piece in each configuration. A mapping from the squares in the grid to the indices of each square are shown below.

		<p>Using this representation, the different configurations of the "L"-shaped piece shown before can be represented a list of different configurations, where each configuration itself is a list of 5 indices which the piece occupies in that configuration.
		<code><pre>
		piece = [[ 0,  5, 10, 15, 16],
		         [ 3,  5,  6,  7,  8],
		         [ 0,  1,  6, 11, 16],
		         [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  5],
		         [ 0,  1,  5, 10, 15],
		         [ 0,  5,  6,  7,  8],
		         [ 1,  6, 11, 15, 16],
		         [ 0,  1,  2,  3,  8]]
		</pre></code>
		
		<p>The code in the file Piece.py sets up the configurations for each of the 12 pieces in this manner, and returns all the pieces as a list. This approach is made a little easier by the fact that not all the pieces need all 8 configurations due to different symmetries possessed by the piece.
